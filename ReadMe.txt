In the folder, you will find: 
* the Simulink model containing the control for the exoskeleton (ExoskeletonControlModel.slx)
* a graphical user interface (GraphicUserInterface.mlapp) and a folder containing pictures used for the grphics
* the script to be run for generating the geometric model rigid body tree (GeometricModel>> ExoskeletonRigidBodyTreeDesign.m)
* a folder containing some parameters exploited by the simulink model

Each file can be viewed in its entirety and reused, making necessary modifications to tailor it to your hardware setup.
